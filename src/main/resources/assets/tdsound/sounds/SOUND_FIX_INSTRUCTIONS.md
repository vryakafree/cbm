# Sound File Fix Instructions

## Issue
The current sound files in this directory are corrupted (only 23 bytes each). This is why Cobblemon sounds are not working properly.

## Required Sound Files
The mod expects these sound files to work properly:
- `victory.ogg` - Plays when you win a battle
- `evo_congrat.ogg` - Plays when a Pokemon evolves
- `catch_congrat.ogg` - Plays when you catch a Pokemon
- `flee.ogg` - Plays when you flee from battle

## How to Fix

### Option 1: Download Sample Sounds
1. Download Pokemon-style congratulatory sounds (OGG format)
2. Rename them to match the expected filenames above
3. Replace the corrupted files in this directory

### Option 2: Create Your Own Sounds
1. Use an audio editor (Audacity, etc.)
2. Create short congratulatory sounds (2-5 seconds)
3. Export as OGG format
4. Place in this directory with the correct names

### Option 3: Use Online Sound Generators
1. Use online tools to generate simple beep/tone sounds
2. Export as OGG format
3. Place in this directory

## File Requirements
- Format: OGG (Vorbis codec)
- Duration: 2-10 seconds recommended
- Sample Rate: 44.1 kHz recommended
- Bitrate: 128-192 kbps recommended

## Testing
After replacing the files:
1. Build the mod: `./gradlew build`
2. Test in-game with commands:
   - `/tdsound test victory`
   - `/tdsound test evolution`
   - `/tdsound test catch`
   - `/tdsound test flee`

## Note
The Cobblemon sound control system (for controlling Pokeball sounds, Pokemon cries, etc.) is now properly integrated and should work once the basic sound files are fixed.
